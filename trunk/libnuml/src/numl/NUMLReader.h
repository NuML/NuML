   * Reads an NUML document from a file.
   *
   * If the file named @p filename does not exist or its content is not
   * valid NUML, one or more errors will be logged with the NUMLDocument
   * object returned by this method.  Callers can use the methods on
   * NUMLDocument such as NUMLDocument::getNumErrors() and
   * @if clike NUMLDocument::getError() @endif@if java NUMLDocument::getError(long n) @endif to get the errors.  The object returned by
   * @if clike NUMLDocument::getError() @endif@if java NUMLDocument::getError(long n) @endif is an NUMLError object, and it has methods to
   * get the error code, category, and severity level of the problem, as
   * well as a textual description of the problem.  The possible severity
   * levels range from informational messages to fatal errors; see the
   * documentation for NUMLError for more information.
   *
   * If the file @p filename could not be read, the file-reading error will
   * appear first.  The error code can provide a clue about what happened.
   * For example, a file might be unreadable (either because it does not
   * actually exist or because the user does not have the necessary access
   * priviledges to read it) or some sort of file operation error may have
   * bee reported by the underlying operating system.  Callers can check
   * for these situations using code such as the following:
   * @code
   * NUMLReader* reader = new NUMLReader();
   * NUMLDocument* doc  = reader.readNUML(filename);
   *
   * if (doc->getNumErrors() > 0)
   * {
   *   if (doc->getError(0)->getId() == XMLError::FileUnreadable)
   *   {
   *     // Handle case of unreadable file here.
   *   } 
   *   else if (doc->getError(0)->getId() == XMLError::FileOperationError)
   *   {
   *     // Handle case of other file error here.
   *   }
   *   else
   *   {
   *     // Handle other cases -- see error codes defined in XMLErrorCode_t
   *     // for other possible cases to check.
   *   }
   * }
   * @endcode
   *
   * If the given filename ends with the suffix @c ".gz" (for example, @c
   * "myfile.xml.gz"), the file is assumed to be compressed in @em gzip
   * format and will be automatically decompressed upon reading.
   * Similarly, if the given filename ends with @c ".zip" or @c ".bz2", the
   * file is assumed to be compressed in @em zip or @em bzip2 format
   * (respectively).  Files whose names lack these suffixes will be read
   * uncompressed.  Note that if the file is in @em zip format but the
   * archive contains more than one file, only the first file in the
   * archive will be read and the rest ignored.
   *
   * @param filename the name or full pathname of the file to be read.
   *
   * @return a pointer to the NUMLDocument created from the NUML content.
   *
   * @see NUMLError
   *
   * @note LibNUML versions 2.x and 3.x behave differently in error
   * handling in several respects.  One difference is how early some errors
   * are caught and whether libNUML continues processing a file in the face
   * of some early errors.  In general, libNUML 3.x stops parsing NUML
   * inputs sooner than libNUML 2.x in the face of XML errors because the
   * errors may invalidate any further NUML content.  For example, a
   * missing XML declaration at the beginning of the file was ignored by
   * libNUML 2.x but in version 3.x, it will cause libNUML to stop parsing
   * the rest of the input altogether.  While this behavior may seem more
   * severe and intolerant, it was necessary in order to provide uniform
   * behavior regardless of which underlying XML parser (Expat, Xerces,
   * libxml2) is being used by libNUML.  The XML parsers themselves behave
   * differently in their error reporting, and sometimes libNUML has to
   * resort to the lowest common denominator.
   *
   * @note To read a gzip/zip file, libNUML needs to be configured and
   * linked with the <a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a> library at
   * compile time.  It also needs to be linked with the <a
   * href="">bzip2</a> library to read files in @em bzip2 format.  (Both of
   * these are the default configurations for libNUML.)  Errors about
   * unreadable files will be logged if a compressed filename is given and
   * libNUML was @em not linked with the corresponding required library.
   *
   * @note NUMLReader::hasZlib() and NUMLReader::hasBzip2() can be used to
   * check whether libNUML has been linked with each library.
