* @class NUMLWriter
* @brief Methods for writing NUML to files and text strings.
*
* @htmlinclude libnuml-not-numl-warning.html
*
* The NUMLWriter class is the converse of NUMLReader, and provides the
* main interface for serializing NUML models into XML and writing the
* result to files and text strings.  The methods for writing NUML all take
* an NUMLDocument object and a destination.  They return a boolean value
* to indicate success or failure.
